    <h2>
      As the COVID-19 virus has remained a threat to society, it is
      that we attempt to protect ourselves and others from the virus.
      The virus is airborne and highly contagious. However, wearing
      a mask can significantly reduce the rate of transmission between
      two people. Public health experts at the Center for Disease Control
      believe that mask use is a form of source control. In other words,
      maks can prevent the spead of water droplets that travel through
      the air when coughing, talking or sneezing because it acts as a barrier.
      deaths could be reduced by 65% with 15% coverage of a highly effective
      mask.

        Disposable masks can be used but if you plan on using a cloth mask
        following these guidelines:

                <h4 class="text"> According to the CDC, Masks should cover your nose and mouth and
                secure snuggly under your chin. Do not wear masks designated for
                healthcare workers, like N95 respirators because they are in short
                supply. Make sure there are no gaps under your chin, on the sides
                or top. You cannot use a face shield or gaiter instead of a face
                mask because there isn't any evidence of the effectiveness of a
                barrier from the virus.</h4>

            Cloth masks should have at lease two layers of fabric. Sometimes
            three layers is also encouraged,however, two layers will suffice.
            Make sure that the cloth used in the mask is a breathable fabric
            like cotton. A fabric like vinyl can make it harder to breath,so
            avoid this material.

              Cloth masks must be cleaned regularly. It can be added to laundry
              and should be dried on high in the dryer. Masks can be washed by
              hand but there are som caveats. The CDC recommends using a
              bleach solution to clean masks by hand. However, John Hopkins
              medicine affirms that masks can be cleaned by hand in hot, soapy
              water for at least 20 seconds. But, they must be dried on high
              in a dryer.
