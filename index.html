    <h4>
      As the COVID-19 virus has remained a threat to society, it is imperative
      that we attempt to protect ourselves and others from the virus.
      Although the virus is airborne and highly contagious, wearing
      a mask can significantly reduce the rate of transmission between
      individuals. Public health experts at the Center for Disease Control
      believe that mask use is a form of source control. In other words,
      maks can prevent the spead of water droplets that travel through
      the air when coughing, talking or sneezing because it acts as a physical
      barrier. According to the National Institutes of Health, COVID-19 deaths
      could be reduced by 65%, if 15% of the public uses a highly effective mask.

        Cloth masks are a great option for people who are not medical workers.

                <p class="text"> According to the CDC, cloth masks should cover your nose and mouth.
                It should secure snuggly under your chin and have no gaps. After selecting a face mask
                try it on and make sure it stays in place as you talk. Some have used cloth
                gaiters instead of a face mask, but there is no evidence that a gaiter is an effective
                barrier.</p>

                  <p class="text">
            Cloth masks should have at lease two layers of fabric. Sometimes
            three layers is also encouraged, however, two layers will suffice.
            Make sure that the cloth used in the mask is a breathable fabric
            like cotton. A fabric like vinyl can make it harder to breath,so
            avoid this material.</p>

              Cloth masks must be cleaned regularly. It can be added to laundry
              and should be dried on high in the dryer. Masks can be washed by
              hand but there are som caveats. The CDC recommends using a
              bleach solution to clean masks by hand. However, John Hopkins
              Medicine affirms that masks can be cleaned by hand in hot, soapy
              water for at least 20 seconds. Nevertheless, hand washed masks must
              be dried on high in a dryer.</p>
